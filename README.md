# The Weather Website
<h2>Final project for CSE383: Web Application Programming</h2>
<p>This is a multi-page web client that features numerous aspects of web programming from front-end to back-end. It uses HTML/CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and AJAX, and PHP for functionalities. The website uses external CSS and Bootstrap 5 components for the good-looking and responsive purposes. Currently, for the history requests on PHP, it only works on Miami University's CEC OpenStack instances. Feel free to check out the repository!</p>

<p>Here are some screenshots of the website:</p>
